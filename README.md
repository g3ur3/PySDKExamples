# DeGirum PySDK Examples

## Quick Start

1. Create an account on [DeGirum Cloud Portal](https://cs.degirum.com). Use *Request Access* button on a main 
page to request access.

1. You should receive registration e-mail within one day. Follow instructions in e-mail to register your account.

1. Log in to [DeGirum Cloud Portal](https://cs.degirum.com).

1. Create cloud API access token on **My Tokens** page accessible via *Management > My Tokens* menu.

1. Install DeGirum PySDK. Read instructions on **General Information** page accessible via
*Documentation > General Information* menu.

1. The following script will download *MobileNetv2+SSD* CPU model from 
DeGirum public mode zoo and perform ML inference of a test image with two cats. 
The inference result will be displayed in both text and graphical form.

    ```python
    import degirum as dg         # import DeGirum PySDK package
    # connect to DeGirum cloud platform and use DeGirum public model zoo
    zoo = dg.connect(dg.CLOUD, "https://cs.degirum.com", "<my cloud API access token>")
    print(zoo.list_models())     # print all available models in the model zoo

    # load mobilenet_ssd model for CPU; model_name should be one returned by zoo.list_models()
    model_name = "mobilenet_v2_ssd_coco--300x300_quant_n2x_cpu_1"     
    model = zoo.load_model(model_name)

    # perform AI inference of an image specified by URL
    image_url = "https://degirum.github.io/images/samples/TwoCats.jpg"
    result = model(image_url)

    print(result)                # print numeric results
    result.image_overlay.show()  # show graphical results
    ```

## Running PySDK Examples

This repository provides PySDK example scripts that can perform ML inferences on the following hosting options:

1. Using [DeGirum Cloud Platform](https://cs.degirum.com),
1. On DeGirum AI Server deployed on a localhost or on some computer in your LAN or VPN,
1. On DeGirum ORCA accelerator directly installed on your local computer.

To try different options, you just need to uncomment **one** of the lines in the code cell just below the
*"Specify where do you want to run your inferences"* header.

To run examples, please perform the following steps:

1. Make sure you have installed Python version 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11. For convenience of future maintenance we recommend 
you to work in the virtual environment, such as [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). 
Make sure you activated your Python virtual environment.

1. Clone DeGirum PySDKExamples repo by executing the following command in the terminal / command prompt:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/DeGirum/PySDKExamples.git
    ```

1. In the terminal / command prompt, change the current directory to the repo directory, and install necessary Python
dependencies by executing the following command:

    ``` Python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Inside the repo directory, open `env.ini` file and fill the required authentication details by assigning the
following variables:

    |Variable Name|Description|
    |-------------|-----------|
    |`DEGIRUM_CLOUD_TOKEN`|DeGirum cloud platform API access token. To obtain a token, visit *Management > My Tokens* page on [DeGirum Cloud Portal](https://cs.degirum.com).|
    |`AISERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP`|The hostname or IP address of a computer in your LAN/VPN which hosts AI Server. For localhost server, specify "localhost". Refer to *Documentation > General Information* page on [DeGirum Cloud Portal](https://cs.degirum.com) for AI server installation details.|
    |`CLOUD_ZOO_URL`|The cloud zoo URL to get models from. Format: `<organization>/<zoo>`. To confirm zoo URL visit *Management > Models* page on [DeGirum Cloud Portal](https://cs.degirum.com).|
    |`CAMERA_ID`|Local camera index, or web camera URL in the format `rtsp://<user>:<password>@<ip or hostname>`, or path to a video file.|

    This will allow loading the required information from the `env.ini` file instead of hard-coding the values in the script. 

    The `env.ini` file is added to `.gitignore` and will not be checked in. This will ensure that your token information 
    is not leaked.
