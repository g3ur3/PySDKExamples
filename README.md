# DeGirum PySDK Examples

## Quick Start

1. Create an account on [DeGirum Cloud Portal](https://cs.degirum.com). Use *Request Access* button on a main page to request access.

1. You should receive registration e-mail within one day. Follow instructions in e-mail to register your account.

1. Log in to [DeGirum Cloud Portal](https://cs.degirum.com).

1. Create cloud API access token on **My Tokens** page accessible via *Management > My Tokens* menu.

1. Install DeGirum PySDK. Read instructions on **General Information** page accessible via
*Documentation > General Information* menu.

1. The following script will download *MobileNetv2+SSD* CPU model from 
DeGirum public mode zoo and perform ML inference of a test image with two cats. 
The inference result will be displayed in both text and graphical form.

    ```python
    import degirum as dg         # import DeGirum PySDK package
    # connect to DeGirum cloud platform and use DeGirum public model zoo
    zoo = dg.connect_model_zoo("dgcps://cs.degirum.com", token="<my cloud API access token>")
    print(zoo.list_models())     # print all available models in the model zoo

    # load mobilenet_ssd model for CPU;
    # model_name should be one returned by zoo.list_models()
    model_name = "mobilenet_v2_ssd_coco--300x300_quant_n2x_cpu_1"     
    model = zoo.load_model(model_name)

    # perform AI inference of an image specified by URL
    image_url = "https://degirum.github.io/images/samples/TwoCats.jpg"
    result = model(image_url)

    print(result)                # print numeric results
    result.image_overlay.show()  # show graphical results
    ```

## Running PySDK Examples

This repository provides PySDK example scripts that can perform ML inferences on the following hosting options:

1. Using [DeGirum Cloud Platform](https://cs.degirum.com),
1. On DeGirum-hosted AI server node shared via Peer-to-Peer VPN,
1. On AI server node hosted by you in your local network,
1. On AI server running on your local machine,
1. On DeGirum ORCA accelerator directly installed on your local machine.

To try different options, you need to just change the `inference_option` variable in the script code.

To run the examples, clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/DeGirum/PySDKExamples.git
```

Inside the repo, create an `.env` file and fill the required authentication details by assigning the following variables
(you may use alternative name `env.ini` if you work under Jupyter Lab GUI, which does not allow you to create hidden 
files):

|Variable Name|Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|`DEGIRUM_CLOUD_TOKEN`|DeGirum cloud platform API access token, obtained on [DeGirum Cloud Platform](https://cs.degirum.com) site.|
|`P2P_VPN_SERVER_ADDRESS`|IP address of DeGirum-hosted AI server node shared via Peer-to-Peer VPN; please contact support@degirum.com to obtain one.|
|`LOCAL_NETWORK_SERVER_ADDRESS`|IP address of AI server node hosted by you in your local network; refer to *Documentation > General Information* page on [DeGirum Cloud Portal](https://cs.degirum.com) for AI server installation details.|
|`CAMERA_ID`|Local camera index, or web camera URL in the format `rtsp://<user>:<password>@<ip or hostname>`, or path to video file.|

This will allow loading the required information from the `.env` file instead of hard-coding the values in the script. 
You can copy the below lines and fill in the missing information.
```
DEGIRUM_CLOUD_TOKEN = 'Enter your DeGirum cloud platform token'
P2P_VPN_SERVER_ADDRESS = 'Enter IP address of the DeGirum P2P AI server'
LOCAL_NETWORK_SERVER_ADDRESS = 'Enter IP address of the AI server in your local network'
CAMERA_ID = 'rtsp://<user>:<password>@<ip or hostname>'
```

The `.env` file is added to `.gitignore` and will not be checked in. This will ensure that your token information is not leaked.
